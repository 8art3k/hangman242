# Hangman242
 
 ## Description:
  - Hangman Game project is a command-line implementation of the classic word-guessing game "Hangman." The program selects a random word from a predefined word list, and the player attempts to guess the letters of the word within a limited number of lives. The project was developed to deepen understanding of Python concepts such as classes, methods, control flow, and basic list operations.
 
 ## Installation instructions:
   - To play the game, run the following script in your command-line terminal:
   python milestone_5.py

 ## Usage instructions:
   - The program will randomly select a word, and the player will have five lives to guess the word correctly.
   - Enter a single alphabetical character to guess a letter in the word.
   - The program will notify if the guess is correct or incorrect, and display remaining lives if the guess is wrong.
   - Guess all letters in the word to win, or lose if lives reach zero.
